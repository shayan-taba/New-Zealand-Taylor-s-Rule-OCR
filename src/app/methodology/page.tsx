        The data used in this project comes from the <strong>Projections Table</strong> of the Monetary Policy Statement. It includes key economic indicators such as output gaps, inflation expectations, and the long-term nominal interest rate (NIR). The NIR data is sourced from the Reserve Bank's research article <Link href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2024/04/finding-neutral#:~:text=As%20inflation%20expectations%20continue%20to,reducing%20inflation%20in%20New%20Zealand." target="_blank">Finding Neutral: Estimates of New Zealandâ€™s Nominal Neutral Interest Rate</Link>, providing a more granular NIR figure (up to two decimal places) from 1997 to 01/02/24.
